This is part 3 of a three-part blog series where we will be looking at connecting my old [Kenwood KR-V7080 Receiver](https://www.hifiengine.com/manual_library/kenwood/kr-v7080.shtml) to the internet and controlling it using [Siri Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334). In this post we will be:

* Connecting the KR-V7080 Receiver to an Azure IoT Hub
* Expose the KR-V7080 Receiver to the World Wide Web with an Azure Function
* Setting up Siri shortcuts to control the KR-V7080 Receiver using voice commands

If you feel like you need a bit of context to get up to speed, do check out my previous posts in the series:

* [Part 1: An Introduction To IR Modules Using An Arduino Uno](/2022/04/17/an-introduction-to-ir-modules.html)
* [Part 2: Bluetooth Communication Using A HM-10 Module](/2022/05/09/bluetooth-communication-using-a-hm-10-module.html)

## But Why?

1. Ok, I know some of you are wondering why would anyone want to use this old thing nowadays let alone trying to control it from the phone. Well you are somewhat right, it is an old thing and I wouldn't be getting more than $100 for it. So I thought it would be a more fun challenge to lift the lid and see what it takes to connect it to the internet and control it with our voice.

2. Why voice commands? So I was watching [Ad Astra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Astra_(film)) the other day, it's a Sci-Fi movie set in a not so distant future. Well there was scene where Brad Pitt was composing an email/message to his wife via an AI personal assistant and I thought how cool it would be to control things around the house with voice commands. Initially I thought of using [Amazon Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa), but then I stumbled on Siri Shortcuts which seems like an easier path given I have an Apple device already.

##### Integrating the Raspberry Pi into the solution

Establishing a BLE data connection between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino device is fairly straight forward process given we have already covered this in the post [Raspberry Pi, meet Arduino. Arduino, meet Raspberry Pi. Letâ€™s talk Bluetooth (LE)](/2021/10/01/raspberry-pi-meet-arduino-arduino-meet-raspberry-pi-let-s-talk-bluetooth-le.html). Let's create a small python application so that we can communicate with our Arduino Uno.

`KenwoodRemoteAgent.py`

               return

         except:

   if __name__ == "__main__":
      asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Let's review the code above to get a rough idea what it's doing. The `main()` method in `app.py` basically create an instance of KenwoodRemoteAgent class with the name `KR-V7080` and the `uuid` (universally unique identifier) associated with the custom BLE characteristic provided by the HM-10 module. It's instance method `run()` then gets invoked where it will try to find the KR-V7080 device and connects to it.

Once connected, the main() method will send the command `power#` followed by `Blah blah#` to the HM-10 module. The HM-10 module acts purely as data channel, it simply take what it received and passes it onto the Arduino Uno and vice versa. Note that the sketch loaded onto the Arduino Uno defines a table of valid commands, so only valid commands are forwarded to the IR Tx module and transmitted to the Kenwood KR-V7080 Receiver.

##### Integrating Azure IoT Hub into the solution

Carrying on from my previous blog posts on Azure IoT Hub we will be using resources created from those blog posts and integrate them into this solution to save me some time. If you want to learn more about Azure IoT Hub, feel free to check them out below:

      asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Now let's run through the code.

We added `AzureIotDeviceAgent.py`, a helper class for connecting to the IoT Hub as well as sending and receiving data from it.
When we want to send data to the IoT Hub, we can invoke the `send_parcel()` method.
When we want to receive data, we register a client via the `add_client()` method. If the incoming data is addressed to the registered client, then the data is passed to that client for handling via the client's `process_parcel()` method.

`KenwoodRemoteAgent.py` was modified to include the `process_parcel()` method as this will be called if data was sent over the internet addressed to this device (`KR-V7080`). All that `process_parcel()` does is forward the data to the Arduino Uno over BLE.

The `main()` method in `app.py` was modified to create an instance of AzureIotDeviceAgent, establishes a connection with the IoT Hub and registers an instance of KenwoodRemoteAgent as a client.

The data that are sent to and received from the IoT Hub are encapsulated as pb_Parcel objects (`parcels`) which contains information about where it came from, where it needs to go and what type of data is in the payload. To help us send these parcels between devices/services/apps over the internet, I have implemented a backend solution (`Multilinks`) consisting of a collection of serverless functions to ensure parcels are forwarded to the correct destination. I hope to blog about Multilinks in more details at some point, but for now just assume a back end service exists to hand parcels over the internet.

## Talking to the KR-V7080 Receiver from the Internet using an Azure Function

At this point we have only connected the KR-V7080 Receiver to the IoT Hub. However we don't really have a way to communicate with the IoT Hub and control the KR-V7080 Receiver.

In this section, we will adding an [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) as a [webhook](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-webhook) to communicate with the KR-V7080 Receiver. The solution will look something like the diagram shown below.

![Communicating With The KR-V7080 Via A Webhook](/assets/posts/2022-07-13-controlling-iot-devices-with-siri-shortcuts/high_level_sequence_diagram_webhook_krv7080.png)

As I have mentioned earlier, I have already implemented `Multilinks`, a backend service that is capable of passing data between two endpoint across the internet. The only requirement is that all endpoints need to be registered with Multilinks' Endpoint Registry, this allows Multilinks to handle the delivery of the data without the sender needing to worry about how it's going to get there. The concept is very similar to the real world scenario where we want to send a parcel to someone. First we put the content in a box, then label where it needs to go and who sent it, then drop it off at the post office. We don't really worry if it's going to get there by land, sea or air as long as it gets there.

The webhook that we are going to create is analogous to the post office where we dropped off the parcel. An implementation of this webhook is shown below.

            {
               requestBody = await streamReader.ReadToEndAsync();
            }

            dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);

               string.IsNullOrEmpty(type) ||
               string.IsNullOrEmpty(content))
            {
               log.LogError("[ExternalServicesInboundAgent] Invalid parcel");
               return new BadRequestObjectResult("Parcel paramters Source, Destination, Type and Content are all required.");
            }

            pb_Parcel parcel = new pb_Parcel();
            parcel.Source = new pb_Endpoint();
            parcel.Destination = new pb_Endpoint();

            parcel.Source.Name = source;
            parcel.Destination.Name = destination;
            parcel.Type = type;
            parcel.Content = content;

            /*
               Let's start the orchestration.
            */
            var instanceId = await starter.StartNewAsync("MultilinksOrchestrator", parcel);

            log.LogInformation("[ExternalServicesInboundAgent] Parcel sent");
            return new OkObjectResult("Parcel sent");
         }
      }
   }
```

Letâ€™s review the code above to get a rough idea of what is going on.

Starting with the function header declaration, we see that it takes 3 parameters:

* `[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req`
* `[DurableClient] IDurableOrchestrationClient starter`
* `ILogger log`

The first is what will trigger this function to be executed, in this case a HTTP POST request. The `AuthorizationLevel.Function` indicates this function is protected by a SAS key (Check out the [Azure Functions HTTP trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger) under the section `Function access keys`).

The second is a `DurableClient` which is used to specify which `Durable Function Orchestrator` to handle the request.

Lastly a logging service for logging purposes.

We expects that the POST request to have a json typed payload containing the following fields:

* source
* destination
* type
* content

If any of these are missing, indicate to the sender with a `bad request` status response. Otherwise, create a parcel using the provided data and pass it onto a function orchestrator to handle i.e. `MultilinksOrchestrator`.

Right, let's try out this new webhook. We are going to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/tools/) to send a POST request. In theory, the request will propagate along as shown in the sequence diagram above and act on the KR-V7080 Receiver as requested.

![Webhook Requests Demo](/assets/posts/2022-07-13-controlling-iot-devices-with-siri-shortcuts/webhook_requests_demo.gif)

In the demo above, we posted 3 HTTP requests.

* In the first, we sent a POST request without any payload and as expected we got a Bad Request response.
* In the second, we sent a POST request with a valid payload. However, the addressed endpoint has not been registered in the `endpoint registry` (plus was not addressed to KR-V7080) so the request was never forwarded to the Arduino Uno and we see no output in the Arduino Uno's serial console.
* Lastly, we sent a POST request with a valid payload and is addressed to KR-V7080. The request was forwarded to the Arduino Uno and we see in the Arduino Uno's serial console that it has received the request and have sent the appropriate IR command to the KR-V7080 receiver.

## Setting up Siri shortcuts to control the KR-V7080 Receiver using voice commands

In this section we are going to expand on the previous section by controlling the KR-V7080 Receiver via voice commands. The solution will look something like the diagram shown below.

As mentioned at the start of this blog post, we will be using [Siri Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) with an Apple Watch to trigger the voice commands. Specifically, we want to use Siri Shortcuts to send a HTTP POST request whenever we say `Stereo On` or `Stereo Off`. I will be summarising what we needed to do for our scenario, but definitely checkout the Siri Shortcuts link above if you want to learn more.

In the image above, two shortcuts have been created. One for when Siri is asked to turn the `stereo on` and one for when Siri is asked to turn the `stereo off`.

In the image above, we see the details of the `stereo on` shortcut:

* The sub heading `Hey Siri, Stereo On` is the voice command that will trigger this shortcut
* The request will be sent to `https://webhookaddress.com?code=access-code-goes-here`
* The request will be a HTTP `POST`
* The payload will be a `JSON` object containing the `parcel` data

Below is a demo of the Shortcuts in action. What we have is an Arduino Uno, an Apple Watch and the Kenwood stereo. The Apple Watch is used to issue voice commands which Siri processes and sends them off onto the Internet, which then gets forward to the Arduino Uno which turns the stereo on and off.

## Final thoughts

While we achieved what we set out to do, I wasn't too happy with the latency I was seeing (but I guess is expected given the solution involves so many network-bound tasks). E.g:

* Siri processing the voice command and converting it to a HTTP request
* The serverless function may require a [cold start](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/understanding-serverless-cold-start/)
* Processing the request sent from the IoT Hub to the Raspberry Pi.

In the worst case scenario, it would take around 10-15 seconds to complete a request. But generally, it takes around half of that time. While we can't do much about the latency due to Siri I reckon we definitely can improve the latency of the other two, but I think I 'll leave that for another day.
